// ------------------------------Modules------------------------------
// |- A module is designed with the idea to organize code written in TypeScript. Modules are broadly divided into âˆ’
//      |- Internal Modules :
//      |- External Modules :

// Internal Module :-------------------------------->
//|- Internal modules came in earlier version of Typescript.
//|- This was used to logically group classes, interfaces, functions into one unit and can be exported in another module. This logical grouping is named namespace in latest version of TypeScript.
//|- So internal modules are obsolete instead we can use namespace. Internal modules are still supported, but its recommended to use namespace over internal modules.
